Hello, my name is Vladimir Prelevic and today I will show you how to successfully evaluate a company based on its financial statements. This method will allow you to estimate if a company is overvalued or undervalued by the market. Lets get to it!

## How to set up the model

We will start by setting up the evaluation model for Company A based on its financial statements.
So in these 4 pictures you can see the 3 main components of the model (Financial statements) and the model itself. Since you already know how to create financial statements from the previous chapters we will skip to explaining the model. 

The most important part is to set up a timeline when you are going to estimate a cash flow for a certain period of time (5 years)(pic 4).

On the right side of pic 4 are the already given values like tax rate,B, market return and risk free rate. However it would be a very good idea to use this area to set up WACC and Cost of Equity calculations.
There is also a set of formulas to help you with the calculations. When mastering these models the most efficient manner of progress is repetition.

## Cost of Equity and WACC

`@script`
Before we jump to estimating Cash Flows , we have to be sure that the parameters which we use for it are "on point". 

As you can see in picture 1 I have used the CAPM formula (Rf+B*(RM-Rf) to calculate our cost of equity. Cost of equity is a return figure that the firm pays its in investors in order to compensate them for their risk exposure. 
Ce (8.97%) is a factor in your Weighted Average cost of Capital (WACC) calculation. WACC is the average rate of return a company expects to compensate all its different investors. Both debt and equity. As you can see in pic 2 I first calculated D/E ratios(42,3/57,7) which we will use as weights to both rate of returns. Take the risk free rate as the cost of debt in this case. Now we multiply the weights with both costs and Tax shield (1-T) in the case of debt in order to get WACC (6.03%). Interest on equity does not pay debt thats why tax shield only applies to debt.

## FCF evaluation

So as we know the WACC and Ce we can proceed to FCF estimation. As you can see in pic 1 I have calculated the FCF by adding up all the operating components (EBIT, Taxes payed, DEP 0, Capex (the change in capital expenditure) and NETWC (CA+CL)).

The second step is to estimate the Free Cash flows for the given period since the value of the firm is the PV of its Future FCF. Hence in pic 2 you can see that I just applied the given constant growth rate (5%) to each period (compounded) in order to get the future values.

Then as shown in pic 4 I discounted (FCFn/(1+WACC)^n) all the FCF and added them up to get the enterprise value. Once I got the enterprise value I deducted the short term CA like Securities or Cash (in this case) and total Debt in order to reach the equity value (1.7mil)

The number of shares outstanding will usually be shown in the Financial statements , in the case of Company A its 150,000. Hence the value of the share is =equity/number of shares. The of Company A's share is 11.61$.
