`@script`
Hello, everyone my name is Vladimir Prelevic and today I will be covering the application of MIN, MAX, MEAN and MEDIAN Spreadsheet functions on simple Data Sets.

## Exercise Topics

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "44198441bb"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- Why do we use these functions?

- How do we use these functions on a Data Set?

- What is the difference between Mean and Median function?

- How do we interpret the results?


`@script`
**So why do we use these functions? **
These functions let us manipulate different data sets in order to give us a short answer to the question of what is a MIN, MAX, MEAN and MEDIAN number of that particular Data Set?

**In this lesson we will also discover how to correctly apply these functions on Spreadsheets. **

**Afterwards we will discuss the difference the difference between the MEAN or Average and the MEDIAN?
**

Finalizing with the revision of what we have learned about applying and interpreting the results of these function.
