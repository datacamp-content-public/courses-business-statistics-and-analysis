`@script`
Hello, everyone my name is Vladimir Prelevic and today I will be covering the application of MIN, MAX, MEAN and MEDIAN Spreadsheet functions on simple Data Sets.

## Exercise Topics

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "44198441bb"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- Why do we use these functions?

- How do we use these functions on a Data Set?

- What is the difference between Mean and Median function?

- How do we interpret the results?


`@script`
**So why do we use these functions? **
These functions let us manipulate different data sets in order to give us a short answer to the question of what is a MIN, MAX, MEAN and MEDIAN number of that particular Data Set?

**In this lesson we will also discover how to correctly apply these functions on Spreadsheets. **

**Afterwards we will discuss the difference the difference between the MEAN or Average and the MEDIAN?
**

Finalizing with the revision of what we have learned about applying and interpreting the results of these function.

## Minimum (MIN)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "475e7c13d5"
```

`@part4`



`@script`
In the fist picture you can see a simple data set from 1 to 10 created in column A. In this case we want to find the smallest number in the set. In order to do so we have to engage the Min function, =MIN(. We can do this by typing =MIN in column C. Once we engage the function it will ask us to add variables (number 1, number 2..). 

We can do this by selecting all the numbers from A1 to A10 as shown in the second picture.

The function gives us 1 as the result which is the smallest number in the set indeed.

## Maximum (MAX)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "5993cb0dd9"
```

`@part1`

`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/1957939c85ebb02b760f7e1523a8001e811cc977/MAX%20function%202.PNG)


`@part3`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/2bc1b5082fadcc01c375cf359d7e715a1c00fef1/Max%20function%203.PNG)


`@part4`



`@script`
The functions of MIN and MAX are applied in exactly the same manner as you can see in all three pictures. The only different is that this time instead of calling function MIN you will call for =MAX( and proceed to add numbers from A1 to A10 as done with the MIN previously.

In this case the function will show the highest number from the set, which is 10 as shown in picture number 3.

## Average (MEAN)

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "bedb2510f5"
```

`@part1`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/0c5fc2edf27781a5fd6d84e092a6e1894392ea71/Mean%201.PNG)


`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/11be77205256be2cd046f9a008866e0f5da8f18a/Mean%202.PNG)


`@script`
Mean is another expression for average. Hence the function in Excel is called AVERAGE. So you would call for =AVERAGE( and not =MEAN( if you would like to execute the function. 

As you can see in the pictures shown above the procedure is exactly the same as in the previous two functions. The result is shown in column D and it's 5.5, which is the average number from the given data set.
