Hello, my name is Vladimir Prelevic and in this lesson I will be talking about some very useful and simple functions used in Excel Spreadsheets. Today we will focus on Minimum, Maximum , Mean (Average) and  Median (Middle).

## Topics and question we will cover

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "6e7173a494"
```

`@part1`
- What are MIN, MAX , MEAN and MEDIAN?

- When and how to use these functions?

- The difference between MEAN and MEDIAN?

- How to interpret the results?


`@script`
In order for you to fully understand the practical usage of these function , today we will focus on answering these 4 important questions:

- What are MIN, MAX , MEAN and MEDIAN?

- When and how to use these functions?

- The difference between MEAN and MEDIAN?

- How to interpret the results?

## Minimum (MIN)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "c1054c870c"
```

`@script`
So MIN or Minimum is an Excel function which will analyze a given Data set and return the smallest value from the set as the result. 
In picture 1 you can see a Data set from 1-10, in order to find the smallest value we have to call =MIN(. The function suggests you add number 1, number 2 and so on..Hence we will left click and select all numbers in column A as shown in pic 2. After doing that we will press enter and run the function.
As shown in Pic 3 the function will tell us that the smallest value is 1, which we can also logically conclude.
Now you may ask why is this useful when its obvious that 1 is the minimum?
Well if we have a chaotic data set like in pic 4 , the minimum isn't as clear as before but the function still works and returns 1 as a minimum. So imagine working on data sets which consists of 1000 different points. Finding the smallest value wouldn't be easy at all without this function.

## Maximum (MAX)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "8edd9ae4a8"
```

`@part1`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/73bc2b4ebeee1e309bbf13e89f677c7c3bd78c8f/Max%20function%201.PNG)


`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/1957939c85ebb02b760f7e1523a8001e811cc977/MAX%20function%202.PNG)


`@part3`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/2bc1b5082fadcc01c375cf359d7e715a1c00fef1/Max%20function%203.PNG)


`@part4`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/00c9cf61d2b07ff188bc4b02658afc033c095bfa/Max%204.PNG)


`@script`
Calling function MAX or Maximum is exactly the same process as calling the Minimum. The difference is that in this case you would type =MAX( as shown in pic 1. Instead of the smallest number from the set the function will return the largest number from the set this time. 
As you can see in pic 4 it also applies for chaotic data sets and gives us back the same result.

## Average (MEAN)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "653c56dc3f"
```

`@part1`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/0c5fc2edf27781a5fd6d84e092a6e1894392ea71/Mean%201.PNG)


`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/11be77205256be2cd046f9a008866e0f5da8f18a/Mean%202.PNG)


`@part3`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/0f25e350121cef93936916d027d13db5883bce68/Mean%203.PNG)


`@part4`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/8ddc5d6b36af0078883cb0d67f5ceabe301b6a0a/Mean%2030.PNG)


`@script`
MEAN is another word for Average, hence if you want to determine an average value of any data set you just call =AVERAGE( and select the data set. Remember the function is called AVERAGE and not MEAN. The function behaves the same way as MIN and MAX and it will return an average value as the result as shown in both pic 2 and 3. Since in pic 3 we have two 5s instead of 5 and 6 our average is lower. 

In picture 4 we can see that the function works perfectly well on the large data set as well.

## Middle (MEDIAN)

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "f5a08d952f"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`

`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4087/datasets/883264061eb7ec255151378d2ce90a3f924ffa9b/Median%20funciton%203.PNG)

`@script`
MEDIAN is another word for Middle. Instead of finding the average number, the function =MEDIAN( as shown in pic 1 will deliver the middle number of the data set. This is demonstrated in pic 2. The function performs this by counting backwards from 10 and 1 until it meets the middle number from both sides. 

You might wonder why is then the MEDIAN 5.5 in pic 2? 
In this case the data set is even hence there is no middle number , that is why the function chooses 2 middle numbers and finds their average. Hence 5+6 / 2 =5.5 .

To prove the point you can take a look at pic 3 where 11 is included in the set making it odd, the equation gives us 6 as the median since it can count 5 numbers from both sides until it arrives to 6.
